Certainly! Let's dive into each component of HashMap implementation with detailed explanations and examples.
//  better see the class notes or notes made by me in the 1st DSA note .
1.Hashtable:

A Hashtable is a data structure that stores key-value pairs. It is implemented using an array of slots or buckets, where each bucket can hold multiple items. The main idea behind a Hashtable is to use a hash function to convert keys into unique numerical indices, which are used to determine the bucket where the corresponding value will be stored.

2.Hash Function:

A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that takes an input (such as a key) and produces a fixed-size numerical value, known as a hash code. The hash code is used to index into the array of buckets in the Hashtable.
Example: Suppose we have a simple hash function that calculates the sum of the ASCII values of characters in a string and takes the remainder when divided by the size of the Hashtable. So, for the key "apple", the hash function might produce a hash code of 1.


3.Collision Handling Techniques:

Collisions occur when two different keys produce the same hash code, leading to a situation where multiple key-value pairs need to be stored in the same bucket.
There are several collision handling techniques, including separate chaining, open addressing, and Robin Hood hashing. We'll focus on separate chaining for this explanation.

4.Separate Chaining:
Separate chaining is a collision resolution technique where each bucket in the Hashtable maintains a linked list (or another data structure) of key-value pairs that hash to the same index.
Example: Suppose we have a Hashtable with 10 buckets, and the hash function for the key "apple" produces a hash code of 1. If the key "apple" and the key "banana" both hash to index 1, they will be stored in a linked list within the same bucket.
Example:

Let's say we have a Hashtable to store the population of cities. The keys are city names, and the values are population counts.
We use a hash function to convert each city name into a numerical index for the Hashtable.
If two cities, "New York" and "Los Angeles", both hash to the same index, a collision occurs.
With separate chaining, we handle this collision by storing both cities in a linked list within the same bucket.
Retrieval: When we want to retrieve the population of "New York", we use the hash function to find the bucket, then search the linked list within that bucket to find the key-value pair associated with "New York".
In summary, a Hashtable uses a hash function to convert keys into numerical indices, but collisions can occur. Separate chaining resolves collisions by storing multiple key-value pairs in the same bucket using linked lists or similar data structures. This allows efficient storage and retrieval of key-value pairs even in the presence of collisions.
